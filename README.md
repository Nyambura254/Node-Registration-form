# Node-Registration-form
 Node.js and the Express framework to build a simple registration form with basic validation, which persists its data to a MongoDB database. We’ll add a view to list successful registration, which we’ll protect with basic HTTP authentication, and we’ll use Bootstrap to add some styling.
